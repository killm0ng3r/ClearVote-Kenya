# ClearVote-Kenya

A blockchain-based voting system for Kenyan elections with transparent, tamper-proof vote recording.


## Overview

ClearVote-Kenya is a secure, transparent voting system that leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of the electoral process. The system consists of three main components: a backend API for data management, Ethereum smart contracts for vote recording, and a frontend web application for user interaction.

## Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:
1. **Frontend**: React-based web application for user interaction
2. **Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript API with Prisma ORM for data management
3. **Blockchain**: Ethereum smart contracts for immutable vote recording



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Truffle Suite (for blockchain development)
- Ganache (for local blockchain testing)
